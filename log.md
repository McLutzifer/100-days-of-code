# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: CS50, week 8, Web Track. Starting over with the Flask Video since it's been a while

**Thoughts:** Finally decided to start the 100 days of code challenge and finish Harvard's CS50 course. Since I still don't know where to start I'm going to finish CS50's Tracks and the final project. Meanwhile using this fork to learn git/GitHub -> goal is to have a commit at an open source project by day 100.

### Day 2: December 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp | Basic Javascript from 70/111 to 88/111

**Thoughts:** Decided to finish ALL my open courses. Worked on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification today. Still searching for a "real" project for this challenge.

### Day 4: December 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: continued 'Learning GitHub' Course on LinkedIn Learning. Also started the 'definitive guide to pointers in C and C++' by freeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts:** Did not find the time to continue on CS50, so I tried to finish the GitHub Course. Did not make it to the end though.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
