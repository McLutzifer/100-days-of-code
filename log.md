# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: CS50, week 8, Web Track. Starting over with the Flask Video since it's been a while

**Thoughts:** Finally desided to start the 100 days of code challenge and finish Harvard's CS50 course. Since I still don't know where to start I'm going to finish CS50's Tracks and the final project.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
