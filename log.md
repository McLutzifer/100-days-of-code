# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: CS50, week 8, Web Track. Starting over with the Flask Video since it's been a while

**Thoughts:** Finally decided to start the 100 days of code challenge and finish Harvard's CS50 course. Since I still don't know where to start I'm going to finish CS50's Tracks and the final project. Meanwhile using this fork to learn git/GitHub -> goal is to have a commit at an open source project by day 100.

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp | Basic Javascript from 70/111 to 88/111

### Day 4: December 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: continued 'Learning GitHub' Course on LinkedIn Learning. Also started the 'definitive guide to pointers in C and C++' by freeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts:** Did not find the time to continue on CS50, so I tried to finish the GitHub Course. Did not make it to the end though.

### Day 5: December 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with SQL
**Thoughts:** Noticed that I really lack in SQL so I started 'practical SQL' by nostarch press

### Day 6: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: SQL creating and populating tables. Simple queries.
**Thoughts:** Making good progress with SQL but in SQLite since I can't bring pgAdmin to work on Manjaro (and don't want to use postgres in Terminal)
